// Phase 10 (Open Items A) validated the thin `block{state blockState}` wrapper
// against real code and COLLAPSED it: it was a one-field struct with no methods
// and no runtime role beyond holding its state — every caller reached straight
// through to blockState. blockState carries the materialization methods
// (AIMessage/ToolUses) directly, so the wrapper added no value (YAGNI). The step
// wrapper was collapsed for the same reason; the turn runtime state is the real
// one and is owned by the actor.

// contributes no block; an all-empty blockState yields an AIMessage with no
// blocks. The tool-use blocks carry the RAW concatenated Input verbatim; any
// validation or sanitization of the stored message is the caller's policy.
